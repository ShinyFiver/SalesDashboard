# Sales Dashboard
This is another project that i put for data visualization stuff. This stuff takes the cake because lots of new variable and bunch of sale terms i need to understand before making the dashboard.
This dataset is about sales from bunch of e-commerce platform in Indonesia. One of the column is taken out with SQL query based.

First, handle the data because original dataset barely finish the data. Doing concat for orderID, vlookup for each goods category, changing date format, calculate revenue, sales, revenue, and profit., Also, try to dissect SQL query in excel and put each query in different column is challenging for me in here, lots of hidden column here and there hehehe. But it's a good practice.

Second, handle the dashboard. I make two dashboard in one excel because so much data in here. General and Product dashboard.
I show total sales, revenue, item sold, average, rating, sales performance, etc with various graph. I personally like treemap chart rather than pie chart to show composition. Try to modify slicer little bit in here to see more visually appealing. And also, using symbol is good addition.
For product dashboard, using map chart feature, data validation, and combined graph is good to convey two variable sales like profit based on category is amazing. 

Overall, this dataset test me lots of excel knowledge, i recommend every one to try this dataset for practice in home. The one i put in here is the complete dashboard from me, i protected the sheet to make dashboard not behave weirdly. I'll put the original dataset and the instruction for your practice at home.
