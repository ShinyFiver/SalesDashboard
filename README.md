# Sales Dashboard
This is another project that i put for data visualization stuff. This stuff takes the cake because lots of new variables and a bunch of sales terms i need to understand before making the dashboard.
This dataset is about sales from various of e-commerce platforms in Indonesia. One of the columns is taken out with SQL query based.

First, handle the data because the original dataset barely finishes the data. Doing concat for orderID, vlookup for each goods category, changing date format, calculating revenue, sales, revenue, and profit. Also, trying to dissect SQL queries in excel and put each queries in a different column is challenging for me in here, lots of hidden columns here and there hehehe. But it's good practice.

Second, handle the dashboard. I make two dashboards in one excel because so much data is here. General and Product dashboard.
I show total sales, revenue, item sold, average, rating, sales performance, etc with various graphs. I personally like treemap chart rather than pie chart to show composition. Try to modify slicer a little bit here to make it more visually appealing. And also, using symbols is a good addition.
For product dashboard, using a map chart feature, data validation, and a combined graph is good to convey two variable sales as profit based on category is amazing. 

Overall, this dataset tests me with lots of excel knowledge. I recommend everyone to try this dataset for practice at home. The one i put on here is the complete dashboard from me, i protected the sheet to make the dashboard not behave weirdly. I'll put the original dataset and the instructions for your practice at home.
